### Introduction 

The Internet stands as one of the most remarkable and outstanding evolutions in modern society. Today, the internet is being used by approximately 67.9% of the global population, connecting people, businesses, and communities all around the world. Its origins trace back to the late 1960s when the Arpanet was created, a U.S. defence research network designed to enable secure and reliable data sharing between multiple computers at once. Over time, the Arpanet expanded into a global network, laying the groundwork for the internet and, later, the WWW (World Wide Web). The internet has reshaped society, revolutionising how people communicate, learn, and interact with people all over the world, something that people could not even dream of back in the 1900s. The internet has also redefined the business world, giving people access to the e-commerce, digital marketing, and global online enterprises that in today's economies drive people to start up new businesses. The internet has also allowed a societal change, as people can now Facetime, using built in cameras all over the world and can also use phone service that allows one person from one country to make a phone call to another person in another country. Networking also allows workplaces to do online meetings without having to meet up in a specific place. This discussion will examine the development of the internet from Arpanet to the world wide web; it will focus on its evolution and impacts that it now has in the modern era.  

### Historical development 
ARPANET, the first ever operational packet switching network designed in the late 1960s to enable communication between research insitutions, the APRANET introduced revolutionary methods for data transmissions that reshaped how the future of networking worked. October 29th, is when the first ever message was sent and this has been marked as the "birth of the internet". From the production of the ARPANET this inspired decades of innovation which led to such developments like protocols, network expansions and eventually the World Wide Web.

#### Key Developments 

##### 1960s- Concept of computing networking 

During the cold war, the U.S, Department of defence, found a way to way to survive system and network failures. A computer scientist by the name of Licklider proposed an idea called the "Galactic network", this idea was so that computers could share data to each other.  

##### 1969- launch of the ARPANET 

The ARPANET was the first ever operational packet-switching network in which through decades of innovation is now known as the "Internet". On October 29th, 1969, a message was sent between UCLA and Stand Ford Research Institute and that message was "Login". This marked the birth of the Internet.  

##### 1971- creation of the Email 

Ray Tomlinson, a computer engineer, developed the electronical mail, now known as "Email", this email is now one of the most used forms of communication to ever exist. To do this Ray Tomlinson developed the "@" symbol, this symbol separated the user's name from the computers host allowing people to create email addresses.  

##### 1973- TCP/IP 

Researcher Vinton Cerf and his partner Robert Kahn created the Transmission Control Protocol and Internet Protocol; this one invention is what allows multiple different computers to connect to each other by giving them separated IP addresses.  

##### 1983- The internet 

January 1st, 1983, ARPANET officially adopted the TCP/IP into its standard communication protocol, this one protocol is what people call the "Official birth of the internet". Paul Mockapetris invented DNS the same year which allowed users to read names of websites like "wwww.example.com"  

##### 1989-1990- World Wide Web 

Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web (WWW) using three main elements 
(1)-HTML-Hypertext Markup Language 
(2)-HTTP-Hypertext Transfer Protocol
(3)-URL-Uniform Resource Location 
This is when Websites were officially created and in 1991 the first website went live.
