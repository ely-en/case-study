## Introduction 

The Internet stands as one of the most remarkable and outstanding evolutions in modern society. Today, the internet is being used by approximately 67.9% of the global population, connecting people, businesses, and communities all around the world. Its origins trace back to the late 1960s when the Arpanet was created, a U.S. defence research network designed to enable secure and reliable data sharing between multiple computers at once. Over time, the Arpanet expanded into a global network, laying the groundwork for the internet and, later, the WWW (World Wide Web). The internet has reshaped society, revolutionising how people communicate, learn, and interact with people all over the world, something that people could not even dream of back in the 1900s. The internet has also redefined the business world, giving people access to the e-commerce, digital marketing, and global online enterprises that in today's economies drive people to start up new businesses. The internet has also allowed a societal change, as people can now Facetime, using built in cameras all over the world and can also use phone service that allows one person from one country to make a phone call to another person in another country. Networking also allows workplaces to do online meetings without having to meet up in a specific place. This discussion will examine the development of the internet from Arpanet to the world wide web; it will focus on its evolution and impacts that it now has in the modern era. 

Throughout the 1970s and 1980s ARPANET continued to grow which allowed more universities to connect into the project, this expansion created a higher quality digital environment where information could move freely. The developments of TCP/IP in 1983 unified different networks into one interconnected system, what we recognise as the modern internet. The next major milestone was when Tim Berners invented the WWW (World Wide Web), the World Wide Web was something anybody could use for the likes of entertainment, social interaction, to use hyperlinks and to allow business to grow. The World Wide Web became extremely popular now decades later it has become the most used invention in history as colleges, school, hospitals, and business all use the internet today to teach or to promote products online. 

## Historical Development
The development of the internet was through decades of innovation shaped by ideas, cold war and influential work of computer scientists. The researchers wanted to build a communication system that wouldn't fail or get disrupted and to allow other computers to share data with each other along long distances. Key figures such as J.C.R Licklider whose vision of an interconnected global network inspired many of the developments that followed, his work inspired many others to follow after him which layed the foundation of the future where computers can communicate without issue.

Other key figures such as Leonard Kleinrock, Ray Tomlinson, Vint Cerf and many more all played major roles in the major technological breakthroughs. Their inventions have become few of the most used on the internet today, such as, TCP/IP email and domain names which allowed the Internet to grow from a small, military academic communication device to a world wide technological device in which billions of users can access.

The following timeline highlights the most significant milestones which created the internet in this historical development, each of these major events played a huge part in how the World Wide Web was created to what we know of today.



#### Major Milstones: From ARPANET to the World Wide Web
###### 1. Early 1960s- The vision for computing networking 

We begin with the one who started it all, J.C.R Licklider, who had a vision of a world where computers could seamlessly connected to one another, though only theoretical and not sure if could ever be possible, the idea shaped ARPA's research priorities and inspired a future on digital communication. His vision marked the very beginning of the decades of innovation that came.

###### 2.1969-  The first ARPANET Connection

The creation of ARPANET began in 1969 and it was the first ever operational packet switching network. Developed during the Cold War to make sure that the communications could not fail or get disrupted. This invention was by Leonard Kleinrock and its feature was to send messages in small chunks though multiple routes. That same year, the first ever message was recorded and it was between UCLA and Stanford research Institute .

###### 3. 1971- the invention of Email

1971 was the year of the email when Ray Tomlinson invented the first ever electronic mail system which became one of the earliest and most influential uses of the ARPANET. He also introduced the @ symbol, its use is so that it can separate the user from the host and is currently used in every single email address that allows people to send emails to each other online.

###### 4. 1973-1978- Development of TCP/IP

As new networks formed around the world communication between them was difficult and researchers Vint Cerf and Robert Kahn solved this by creating TCP/IP protocols, which allowed different systems to communicate more smoothly and efficiently. After official testing and procedures ARPANET officially swapped to TCP/IP on January 1st 1983, this moment is what people call the "official birth of the Internet".

###### 5. 1983- Introduction of the Domain name system (DNS)

Paul Mockapetris saw that with the growing number of hosts that remembering numerical IP address was almost impossible so to solve this he created the DNS in 1983 to assign readable names to websites making it way easier and smoother to find what your looking for. The DNS created a structured and user-friendly addressing system.

###### 6. 1981-1991- Creation of the World Wide Web
Between the years 1981 and 1991 Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web at CERN, here he developed three essential technologies. 

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)
HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)
URL (Uniform Resource Locator)

These tools introduced what makes the Internet feel really smooth and a great essential element, clickable links, webpages, and browsers, these inventions had transformed the Internet into an accessible multimedia information system. In 1991 the first website went live and the Internet entered a new era where global communication and information became apart of our every day life in the history of the ARPANET to the World Wide Web.



## Business Viewpoint Analysis

### Defining the Business Viewpoint
From a business viewpoint, computing developments were evaluated on how they revolutionized the operation of business. The evolution from ARPANET to the World Wide created an entirety of new business models, it transformed how businesses operate, creating new opportunities for ecommerce, communication, and global market access.

### Transformation from a Business POV

#### **Creation of New Business Models**

**E-Commerce:**

The WWW allowed businesses to start selling products online, making them available to everything, before the WWW, commerce required physical stores, printed catalogs, or telephone ordering systems. As HTML and HTTP was introduced, it allowed brands to create stores online accessibl to anyone with internet. 

##### E-Commerce Business Evidence: #####
- Amazon - founded in 1994 as an online bookstore which grew from a garage startup to a $2.45 trillion comapny.
- eBay - launched in 1995, as a peer to peer marketplace allowing users to buy and sell items between eachother online, making over $10 billion in 2025.
- Small businesses could now access global markets for with a minimal investment as domain and hosting cost under $100 annually comparing to traditional retail stores costing thousands.


**Digital Marketing and Advertising**

The WWW created am entirely new advertising model, as traditional advertising relied on television, radio, news papers and billboards which had a limited target audience as well as scalability. Advertising on the web introduced real time analytics as well as specific audience targeting which allowed brands to target based on age, interests, country and more


##### Marketing Business Evidence: #####
- Google Ads revenue reached $296.15 billion in 2025, built on web based search advertising.
- Metrics such as click through rates, conversion tracking, and A/B testing gave businesses measurable ROI which was impossible with traditional advertising.
- Facebook Ads allows small businesses to start advertising campaigns with budgets as low as $5 per day.

#### **Operational Efficiency Gains**

##### Communication Cost Reduction

Before the World Wide Web it was price consuming for international business to communicate as it required expensive phone calls, fax machines, or postal mail. Commutation tools such as email and web-based commutations reduced these costs to nearly zero, while increasing commutation speeds. 

**Business Evidence:**
- International phone call costs went down from 3 -5$ per minute in 1990s to basically zero via VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) and other web services.
- File sharing changed from overnight shipping which cost anywhere from 25-50 EUR per package to instant web-based file transfer.
- Business meetings etc over WiFi removed the need for business trips saving comapnies a significant amount of time and money.


##### Supply Chain Transformation
Web based systems allowed business to add real time inventory tracking, automated ordering and real time manufacturing requests which completely transformed SCM (supply chain management) and reduced storage and production costs.

**SCM Business Evidence:**
- Walmart's web-based supply chain system lowered inventory costs by 10% while improving stock availability.
- Amazon’s web-based inventory and automation system allowed same day and next day delivery.
- Companys like FexEx and UPS built order tracking systems which users could access from the web, handling thousands of daily queries.





Overall the World Wide Web changed how businesses operate by creating new business models, allowing businesses to advertise and sell online to a global market, and making communications faster while reducing costs.






## Societal Viewpoint Analysis


### Defining the Societal Viewpoint

From a societal viewpoint, compouting developments were evaluated on how they transform quality of life, education, social interactions and more. The evolution from ARPANET to the World Wide Web transformed human communication and information access.


#### **Access to Information**

The World Wide Web changed the accessibility of information from something that was controlled by libraries and universities to something anyone with an internet connection could access. For example, Wikipedia now has over 7 million English articles, making it the worlds biggest encyclopedia with content in over 300 languages.

Educational websites such as [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) or even [Hardvard's Free Courses](https://pll.harvard.edu/catalog/free) and let millions of people learn for free, which is something that was impossible before. Although this is great it has also created its own problems to, such as fake news and misinformation being spread easily online, making it harder for people to tell the difference between what is true and what's not.

#### **Communications**

The World Wide Web transformed the way we communicate with each other, switching physical letters, telephone boots etc to emails, communications apps over the internet and more. Furthermore, the WWW allowed people to connect with each other regardless of language barriers, which otherwise wouldve been impossible, this also led people from other countries and cultural differences to network and work together which further progressed cultural differences amongst people worldwide.

#### **Education Changes**
During COVID 19 pandemic, 77% of U.S public schools and 73% of U.S private schools transitioned to online classes, which shows how web-based education. The World Wide Web also played a huge part during the COVID 19 epidemic. The worldwide access to internet allowed for easy communication throughout the entire world, allowing students and teachers to connect from anywhere within the world whilst also minimizing the risk of spreading the COVID 19 disease. The internet allowed for a smooth continuation of education that otherwise would've been impossible to do.


#### **Privacy and Security**
The World Wide Web has also raised concerns about personal privacy and security, as surveillance has increased, with organisations being able to track user activity, location, behaviours and more through web-based data collection.
Additionally, identity theft has become a major issue, studies show that 1 in 4 people globally have experienced some sort of identity fraud online.
Data breaches have become an issue, as hackers have been targeting financial institutions, to target their user base through scam calls etc, putting peoples real world money and assets on the line, and making it harder to distinguish between real company representatives and scammers, which wasn't an issue in the past as online banks didn't exist. 










## Ethical Reflection
Reviewing our World Wide Web project, it is clear that we explained how the web's technology works, yet there were many ethical aspects we could have explored better. Thinking about ethics matters because the web is not just a technical system which has a direct impact on privacy and accessibility, and digital well-being and information's spread. In hindsight, our project could have shown more responsibility and critical awareness and ethical engagement in many areas.

A key area for improvement is how we handled privacy and data collection. We explained how browsers and servers, and protocols work, but barely touched on how companies collect and track, and monetise user data online. From an ethical view, this is a core piece for understanding how the internet works today. We could have better explored cookies and third-party trackers and targeted ads, and the duties of groups which handle user data. Including real-world cases would make our ethical points stronger and show we grasp the risks which users face online.
We made some upgrades, but there’s another piece we haven’t really dealt with: fake news and online behaviour. Sure, we showed how information zips around the world, but we kind of dodged the whole question of what’s right or wrong about spreading lies or harmful stuff. The internet lets people talk anywhere, anytime—and while that’s powerful, it also makes it way too easy for rumours, abuse, and shady influence to spread. If we really think about it, someone has to take responsibility for stopping false stories without shutting down free speech. Is it the user? The website? The government? That question ties our tech focus back to real harm happening out there.

We also glossed over the fairness issue—who actually gets to use the internet easily? We went on about how the web connects the world, but barely touched on the fact that not everyone gets the same shot at joining in. If we want to be ethical, we have to ask who benefits from online tools and who’s left behind. Plenty of people still don’t have reliable internet, sites that work for all abilities, or even the basic skills to stay safe online. We could’ve made our work stronger by talking about rules for making sites usable, why inclusive design matters, and what responsibility coders have to make sure tech works for everyone—especially people with disabilities.

The emphasis of our project was primarily on the positive aspects of the internet. However, there is a lot of scope for improvement when looking at digital well-being, along with the positives of the internet. Many people are suffering from online fatigue, addiction to the Internet, or mental illnesses as a direct result of being able to connect to others 24 hours a day, seven days a week. It is ethically sound to recognise that these are real issues, and therefore acknowledge them and have a greater understanding of how the Internet will shape people's lives. Including ideas on what companies, developers, and individuals can do to support healthier online habits should have been included in our project to increase the ethical dimension. Finally, we could have improved the ethical aspect of the project by outlining a clear set of practical solutions to help improve the current state of the Internet. For example, we could have developed stronger privacy laws, improved accessibility standards, increased digital literacy education, and established transparent content moderation policies. By providing constructive, actionable recommendations, we would considerably increase the relevance of our ideas.
To conclude my reflection on this project. It does a great job of describing and explaining the basic structure and functionality of the World Wide Web. However, the ethical aspect is largely overlooked in regards to the overall outcome of the project. In enhancing the project, I believe that each of these points, privacy, misinformation, accessibility, sustainability and digital well-being would have been better articulated and structured within the project. Doing so would have enabled the final product to provide a more complete and positive perspective of a technology that continues to influence every aspect of our daily lives.
