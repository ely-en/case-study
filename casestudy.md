## Introduction 

The Internet stands as one of the most remarkable and outstanding evolutions in modern society. Today, the internet is being used by approximately 67.9% of the global population, connecting people, businesses, and communities all around the world. Its origins trace back to the late 1960s when the Arpanet was created, a U.S. defence research network designed to enable secure and reliable data sharing between multiple computers at once. Over time, the Arpanet expanded into a global network, laying the groundwork for the internet and, later, the WWW (World Wide Web). The internet has reshaped society, revolutionising how people communicate, learn, and interact with people all over the world, something that people could not even dream of back in the 1900s. The internet has also redefined the business world, giving people access to the e-commerce, digital marketing, and global online enterprises that in today's economies drive people to start up new businesses. The internet has also allowed a societal change, as people can now Facetime, using built in cameras all over the world and can also use phone service that allows one person from one country to make a phone call to another person in another country. Networking also allows workplaces to do online meetings without having to meet up in a specific place. This discussion will examine the development of the internet from Arpanet to the world wide web; it will focus on its evolution and impacts that it now has in the modern era.  

## Historical development 
ARPANET, the first ever operational packet switching network designed in the late 1960s to enable communication between research insitutions, the APRANET introduced revolutionary methods for data transmissions that reshaped how the future of networking worked. October 29th, is when the first ever message was sent and this has been marked as the "birth of the internet". From the production of the ARPANET this inspired decades of innovation which led to such developments like protocols, network expansions and eventually the World Wide Web.

### Key Developments 

#### 1960s- Concept of computing networking 

During the cold war, the U.S, Department of defence, found a way to way to survive system and network failures. A computer scientist by the name of Licklider proposed an idea called the "Galactic network", this idea was so that computers could share data to each other.  

#### 1969- launch of the ARPANET 

The ARPANET was the first ever operational packet-switching network in which through decades of innovation is now known as the "Internet". On October 29th, 1969, a message was sent between UCLA and Stand Ford Research Institute and that message was "Login". This marked the birth of the Internet.  

#### 1971- creation of the Email 

Ray Tomlinson, a computer engineer, developed the electronical mail now known as "Email", this email is now one of the most used forms of communication to ever exist. To do this Ray Tomlinson developed the "@" symbol, this symbol separated the user's name from the computers host allowing people to create email addresses.  

#### 1973- TCP/IP 

Researcher Vinton Cerf and his partner Robert Kahn created the Transmission Control Protocol and Internet Protocol; this one invention is what allows multiple different computers to connect to each other by giving them separated IP addresses.  

#### 1983- The internet 

January 1st, 1983, ARPANET officially adopted the TCP/IP into its standard communication protocol, this one protocol is what people call the "Official birth of the internet". Paul Mockapetris invented DNS the same year which allowed users to read names of websites like "wwww.example.com"  

#### 1989-1990- World Wide Web 

Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web (WWW) using three main elements 
(1)-HTML-Hypertext Markup Language 
(2)-HTTP-Hypertext Transfer Protocol
(3)-URL-Uniform Resource Location 
This is when Websites were officially created and in 1991 the first website went live.

## Ethical Reflection
Reviewing our World Wide Web project, it is clear that we explained how the web's technology works, yet there were many ethical aspects we could have explored better. Thinking about ethics matters because the web is not just a technical system which has a direct impact on privacy and accessibility, and digital well-being and information's spread. In hindsight, our project could have shown more responsibility and critical awareness and ethical engagement in many areas.

A key area for improvement is how we handled privacy and data collection. We explained how browsers and servers, and protocols work, but barely touched on how companies collect and track, and monetise user data online. From an ethical view, this is a core piece for understanding how the internet works today. We could have better explored cookies and third-party trackers and targeted ads, and the duties of groups which handle user data. Including real-world cases would make our ethical points stronger and show we grasp the risks which users face online.
We made some upgrades, but there’s another piece we haven’t really dealt with: fake news and online behaviour. Sure, we showed how information zips around the world, but we kind of dodged the whole question of what’s right or wrong about spreading lies or harmful stuff. The internet lets people talk anywhere, anytime—and while that’s powerful, it also makes it way too easy for rumours, abuse, and shady influence to spread. If we really think about it, someone has to take responsibility for stopping false stories without shutting down free speech. Is it the user? The website? The government? That question ties our tech focus back to real harm happening out there.

We also glossed over the fairness issue—who actually gets to use the internet easily? We went on about how the web connects the world, but barely touched on the fact that not everyone gets the same shot at joining in. If we want to be ethical, we have to ask who benefits from online tools and who’s left behind. Plenty of people still don’t have reliable internet, sites that work for all abilities, or even the basic skills to stay safe online. We could’ve made our work stronger by talking about rules for making sites usable, why inclusive design matters, and what responsibility coders have to make sure tech works for everyone—especially people with disabilities.

The emphasis of our project was primarily on the positive aspects of the internet. However, there is a lot of scope for improvement when looking at digital well-being, along with the positives of the internet. Many people are suffering from online fatigue, addiction to the Internet, or mental illnesses as a direct result of being able to connect to others 24 hours a day, seven days a week. It is ethically sound to recognise that these are real issues, and therefore acknowledge them and have a greater understanding of how the Internet will shape people's lives. Including ideas on what companies, developers, and individuals can do to support healthier online habits should have been included in our project to increase the ethical dimension. Finally, we could have improved the ethical aspect of the project by outlining a clear set of practical solutions to help improve the current state of the Internet. For example, we could have developed stronger privacy laws, improved accessibility standards, increased digital literacy education, and established transparent content moderation policies. By providing constructive, actionable recommendations, we would considerably increase the relevance of our ideas.
To conclude my reflection on this project. It does a great job of describing and explaining the basic structure and functionality of the World Wide Web. However, the ethical aspect is largely overlooked in regards to the overall outcome of the project. In enhancing the project, I believe that each of these points, privacy, misinformation, accessibility, sustainability and digital well-being would have been better articulated and structured within the project. Doing so would have enabled the final product to provide a more complete and positive perspective of a technology that continues to influence every aspect of our daily lives.
