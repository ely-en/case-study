### Introduction 
The internet stands as one of the most remarkable and outstanding evolutions of todays society in the moderna era, the internet is being used by approximately 67.9% of the global population. It's origins trace back to thelate 1960s when the Arpanet was created, a U.S. defense research network designed to enable secure and reliable data sharing between multiple computers at once. Over time, the Arpanet expanded into a global network, laying the groundwork for the internet and, later the WWW ( World Wibe Web).
The internet has reshaped society, revolutionizing how people communicate, learn and interact with people all over the world, something that people couldn't even dream of back in the 1900s. The internet has also redefined the business world, giving people acces to the e-commerce, digital marketing and global online enterprises that in todays economies drive people to start up new business.
